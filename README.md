# Travel Planner

This website developed the idea of the lecture example that shows how to connect a simple `<form>` to the [OpenAI Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) in the browser, which repo that I forked. 

## Features

* Based on the origin, all costs will be calculated in the origin location's currency. (For example, if you depart from Toronto, all costs is provided in CAD.)
* Based on the choice of duration, budget amount, AI plans accordingly.
* Based on the favorite acitivity type, AI suggests must-go locations and explain why.
* If you have a travel mate in special needs, AI considers it when giving suggestions.
